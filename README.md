### Main Components of a Smart Power Grid

1. **Power Generation** : Sources of electricity (e.g., power plants, solar panels, wind turbines).
2. **Transmission** : High-voltage power lines that transport electricity from generation sources to substations.
3. **Distribution** : Lower-voltage power lines that deliver electricity to consumers.
4. **Consumers** : End-users of electricity, such as households, businesses, and industries.
5. **Utility Companies** : Entities that manage the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity.
6. **Third-Party Data Aggregators** : Companies that collect and manage data from consumers and communicate with utility companies.
7. **Smart Meters** : Devices at consumer locations that measure electricity usage and communicate with utility companies and third-party data aggregators.
8. **Communication Network** : Infrastructure that enables data exchange between smart meters, third-party data aggregators, and utility companies.
9. **Control Systems** : Systems that manage the operation of the power grid, including demand response and load balancing.

### Steps to Build the Simulator

1. **Define the Data Structures** : Create classes for each component of the power grid.
2. **Establish Relationships** : Define how components interact with each other.
3. **Implement Basic Simulation Logic** : Simulate basic operations like power generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption.
4. **Integrate Third-Party Data Aggregators** : Add functionality for data collection and communication.
5. **Simulate Compromised Third-Party** : Introduce scenarios where third-party data aggregators are compromised and study the impact.

### Watt, Voltage and Current

Several important things have to happen in an electrical circuit for electricity to flow and for work to be done.

An electric circuit, uses electrons to carry the electricity.

**Voltage**: Electrical pressure, how strongly electricity is being pushed into the circuit

Voltage is important because many circuits are designed to only accept a certain number of volts.


**Ampere**: A unit of how much electrical charge is flowing past a given point in one second

**Power Formula**: P(watts) = I(amps) * V(volts) 


Watts: How much energy is consumed




Watt (W) measures power, which is the rate of energy transfer. It tells you how much energy is used per second.

Voltage (V) measures electrical potential difference or pressure. It tells you how strong the electrical force is that pushes electric current through a circuit.

Current (measured in Amperes or Amps, A) is the flow of electric charge in a circuit. It tells you how many electrons are moving through a conductor per second.
