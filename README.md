# PyASPG - Smart Power Grid Simulation Framework ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1-orange)

## Overview

PyASPG is a simulation framework for modeling and analyzing smart power grids. It allows users to simulate the behavior of various components in a smart grid, including generators, transmitters, distributors, prosumers, and utility companies. The framework provides a flexible way to define connections between these components and log their interactions over time.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Easily create and manage various components like wind turbines, solar panels, transmitters, distributors, and prosumers.
- **Flexible Connections**: Define and handle connections between different components to simulate real-world smart grid scenarios.
- **Data Logging**: Log detailed data for each component and connection, including power consumption, production, storage, and transmission.
- **Aggregation and Communication**: Collect and aggregate data from smart meters, communicate with utility companies, and manage commands for prosumers.
- **Simulation Control**: Run simulations with customizable durations and timesteps, and generate detailed output files for analysis.

## Installation

To install PyASPG, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyaspg.git
cd pyaspg
pip install -r requirements.txt
